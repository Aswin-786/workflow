# Workflow Builder

A simple drag-and-drop workflow builder application built with **React**, **TypeScript**. This project uses `@xyflow/react` to create a dynamic interface where users can design custom workflows by dragging, dropping, and connecting nodes. The application supports node management, state persistence using `localStorage`, and a responsive design.

## üìù Overview

This project fulfills the requirements of the "**Building a Drag-and-Drop Workflow Builder**" assignment. It features a **workflow canvas** with drag-and-drop functionality, **node editing**, and simulated API integration using **localStorage** to save and load workflow data. The state is managed using **React's Context API** for better state management and easier state propagation throughout the application. The UI is built with **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Radix UI components** for reusable, accessible UI components.
